## AI for Digital Therapeutics Exploration (OpenMed Integration)
- Experiment with open-source healthcare LLMs (OpenMed, ClinicalBERT, BioGPT) to evaluate use in psychophysiology and digital therapy pipelines.
- Built prototypes combining structured EHR-style data + therapeutic transcripts to explore context-aware patient dialogue generation.
- Benchmarked models for clinical safety, empathy, and interpretability — informing future research into LLM-driven mind–body therapy.
